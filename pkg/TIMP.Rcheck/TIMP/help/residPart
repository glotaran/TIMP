     Methods for function 'residPart' in Package `TIMP' determine the 
     part of the residual vector associated with a single `part' of the
     dataset(s).

_U_s_a_g_e:

     residPart(model, group, multimodel, thetalist, clpindepX, finished, returnX,
     rawtheta)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   model: Object of class 'dat'; switches on this  argument. 

   group: list of vector pairs (x2 index, dataset index) for which  the
          part of the residual vector is to be determined

multimodel: Object of class 'multimodel'

thetalist: Object of class 'multitheta'

clpindepX: Object of class 'matrix' containing the matrix determined
          directly by the nonlinear parameters (e.g., a concentration
          matrix in the case of a kinetic model) in the case that this
          matrix does not depend on the 'x2' index

finished: logical determining whether fitting is finished that triggers
          the storage of results

 returnX: logical determining whether to just return the matrix  'X'
          directly dependent on nonlinear parameters; this is used in
          the finite difference derivative of 'X' used to get standard
          error estimates on the  conditionally linear parameters. 

rawtheta: numeric vector of nonlinear parameters to be optimized  by
          'nls'; this is used in the finite difference derivative of
          'X' used to get standard error estimates on the 
          conditionally linear parameters. 

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:
