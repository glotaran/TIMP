     'spec' is the class for spectral models; if 'mod_type = "spec"' 
     is an  input to 'initModel'. All objects of class  'spec' are also
     of class 'dat'; see documentation for 'dat'  for a description of 
     these slots.  Note that here 'x2'  will refer to the independent
     variable in which traces are resolved, e.g., wavelength or
     wavenumber.

     Objects can be created by calls of the form 'new("spec", ...)' or 
     'spec(...)'.

_S_l_o_t_s:

     '_c_l_p_e_q_u': Object of class '"vector"'  of starting values for
          linear relationships between  clp

     '_s_p_e_c_p_a_r': Object of class '"list"'  of vectors of  starting
          values for spectral parameters; the number of vectors gives
          the  number of components in the resulting spectral model;  
          each vector contains the parameters  associated with a
          component.  e.g.,  'specpar = list(c(20000, 3000, .3, 21000,
          2000, .4), c(18000, 1000, .2))'; the parameters in each
          vector are grouped  'c(location_spectra, width_spectra,
          skew_spectra)'.   the location and width parameters are given
          in wavenumbers.  

     '_s_p_e_c_f_u_n': Object of class '"character"',  '"gaus"' for a spectral
          model of a superposition of skewed Gaussians; '"bspline"' for
          a  bspline-based model.  

     '_s_p_e_c_r_e_f': Object of class '"numeric"'  index defining the center
          value of the  'x2' variable.

     '_s_p_e_c_C_o_n': Object of class '"list"'  used internally to  store
          constraints. 

     '_s_p_e_c_d_i_s_p': Object of class '"logical"'  'TRUE' if time-dependence
          of the spectral parameters is to be taken into account and
          'FALSE' otherwise

     '_s_p_e_c_d_i_s_p_p_a_r': Object of class '"list"'  

     '_s_p_e_c_d_i_s_p_i_n_d_e_x': Object of class '"list"'  of vectors defining
          those indexes of specpar whose time-dependence is to be
          modeled.  e.g., 'specdispindex = list(c(1,1),  c(1,2),
          c(1,3))' says that parameters 1-3 of spectra 1 are to be
          modeled as  time-dependent.

     '_n_u_p_o_w': Object of class '"numeric"'   describing the power to
          which wavenumbers are raised in  the model equation; see
          Equation 30 of the paper in the references section  for a
          complete description

     '_t_i_m_e_d_e_p': Object of class '"logical"' describing whether the
          model for spectra E is dependent on x-index (i.e., whether it
          is clp-dependent). 

     '_p_a_r_m_u_f_u_n_c': Object of class '"character"'  describing the
          function form of the  time-dependence of spectral parameters;
          options are '"exp"'  for exponential time  dependence,
          '"multiexp"' for multiexponential time dependence, and 
          '"poly"' for  polynomial time dependence. defaults to
          polynomial time dependence.  

      _n_c_o_l_e  vector describing the number of columns of the E matrix
          for  each value in the 'x' vector

_E_x_t_e_n_d_s:

     Class 'dat-class', directly.
