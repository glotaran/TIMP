getResid                For data correction, fits a model (but ignores
                        plotting commands) in order to obtain the SVD
                        of the residuals, which then can be used in
                        data-correction.

modifyModel             Allows the starting values for parameters
                        associated with a model to be updated with the
                        values found in fitting the model.

                        models, data and the results of fitting.
multitheta-class        Class "multitheta" that stores a list with one
                        element of class "theta" for each dataset
