Description: A problem solving environment (PSE) for fitting separable nonlinear
    models to measurements arising in physics and chemistry experiments,
    as described by Mullen & van Stokkum (2007) <doi:10.18637/jss.v018.i03>
    for its use in fitting time resolved spectroscopy data, and as described by
    Laptenok et al. (2007) <doi:10.18637/jss.v018.i08> for its use in fitting
    Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) data,
    in the study of FÃ¶rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET).
