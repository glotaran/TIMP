<p>

<h4> 
PPViewer is a LabVIEW program by  
<a HREF="mailto:ilstep@gmail.com"> Ilya Stepanenko </a> for interactive 
exploration of data and model fit.  It was designed 
especially for time-resolved spectroscopy applications, and can 
read model fit files output by TIMP, as well as datafiles in the wavelength-explicit format. 

If you don't have LabVIEW 8.2.1 or later, you can run PPViewer under Windows
by installing the free  
<a href="ftp://ftp.ni.com/support/labview/windows/runtime/8.2.1/LVRunTimeEng.exe"> 
LabVIEW Run-time Engine (24MB)</a>.
PPViewer itself doesn't need installation: just unpack the zip archive somewhere and launch PPViewer.exe.
For now binaries, for other platforms are not available.
