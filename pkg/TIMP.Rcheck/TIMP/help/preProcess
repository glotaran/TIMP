    data: Object of class 'dat'

  sample: integer describing sampling interval to take in both time and
           'x2'; e.g., 'sample=2'  will sample every 2nd time and every
          2nd point in  'x2'.

sample_time: integer describing sampling interval in time; e.g.,
          'sample_time=2' will sample every 2nd element of the time
          vector. 

sample_lambda: integer describing sampling interval in 'x2';  e.g.,
          'sample_lambda=2' will sample every 2nd element in the  'x2'
          vector. 

sel_time: vector of length 2 describing the first and last time  index
          of data to select; e.g., 'sel_time=c(5,120)' will select 
          data at times indexed 5-120. 

sel_lambda: vector of length 2 describing the first and last 'x2'  
          index of data to select; e.g., 'sel_lambda=c(5,120)'  will
          select data at 'x2' indexed 5-120. 

baselinetime: a vector of form 'c(timeIndexmin, timeIndexmax, 
          lambdaIndexmin, lambdaIndexmax)'.  The average of data
          between  'x2' indexes   'lambdaIndexmin' and 'lambdaIndexmax'
           is subtracted from data with  time index between
          'timeIndexmin' and 'timeIndexmax'.  

baselinelambda: a vector of form 'c(timeIndexmin, timeIndexmax, 
          lambdaIndexmin, lambdaIndexmax)'.  The average of data
          between time indexes   'timeIndexmin' and 'timeIndexmax'  is
          subtracted from data with 'x2' index  between
          'lambdaIndexmin' and 'lambdaIndexmax'.

   scalx: numeric by which to linearly scale the 'x' axis (which often
          represents time), so that newx = oldx * scalx 

  scalx2: vector of length 2 by which to linearly scale the  'x2' axis,
          so that newx2 = oldx2 * scalx2[1] + scalx2[2]

sel_lambda_ab: vector of length 2 describing the absolute values (e.g.,
          wavelengths, wavenumbers, etc.) between which data should be
          selected.   e.g., 'sel_lambda_ab = c(400, 600)' will select
          data   associated with 'x2' values between 400 and 600. 

sel_time_ab: vector of length 2 describing the absolute times  between
          which data should be selected.   e.g., 'sel_time_ab = c(50,
          5000)' will select data   associated with time values between
          50 and 5000 picoseconds.

   rm_x2: vector of 'x2' indices to remove from the data

    rm_x: vector of 'x' indices to remove from the data

svdResid: list returned from the 'getResid' function, containing
          residuals to be used in data correction. 

    numV: numeric specifying how many singular vectors to use in data
          correction.  Maximum is five. 

_V_a_l_u_e:

     object of class 'dat'.

_A_u_t_h_o_r(_s):
