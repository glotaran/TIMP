     Measurements often represent a superposition of the contributions
     of distinct sub-systems resolved with respect to many experimental
     variables (time, temperature, wavelength, pH, polarization, etc). 
     A parametric model for each component may be desirable to apply to
     the data, but only to the evolution of components with respect to
     a subset of the independent variables.  For instance, given
     time-resolved spectroscopy data, a parametric model for the
     time-evolution of components may be available, while a
     physically-inspired parametric model for the spectra of components
     may be difficult to formulate and interpret.  Such situations give
     rise to a separable nonlinear parameter estimation problem, namely
     that of estimating the (nonlinear) parameters associated with the
     parametric model, while estimating parameters representing the
     evolution of components with respect to the independent variables
     to which a parametric model does not apply as conditionally
     linear.  The partitioned variable projection algorithm is
     well-suited to solving such problems under the criteria of
     efficiency, quality of standard error estimates, and precision of
     parameter estimates.  TIMP implements the partitioned variable
     projection algorithm and allows its application to fitting a wide
     range of models, including those for the simultaneous analysis of
     multiple datasets collected under different experimental
     conditions.  The package has been extensively applied to modeling
     data arising in spectroscopy experiments.
