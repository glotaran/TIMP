<p>

<h4> 
Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) datasets collected using 
time-correlated single photon counting microscopes manufactured by the 
<a href="http://www.becker-hickl.de/"> Becker & Hickl</a> company 
are stored in a proprietary binary format with extension .slt.  
In order to analyze such data with TIMP, pixels for analysis must be 
selected and the data must be converted to the ASCII format described 
<a href="http://www.nat.vu.nl/~kate/FLIM_format/"> here</a>.
The analysis of FLIM data with TIMP was described in the paper
 <strong><a href="http://www.jstatsoft.org/v18/i08/">
      Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) Data Analysis 
      with TIMP</a></strong>.

In order to interactively view the contents of a .slt file and 
select pixels from such a file that are of interest for 
analysis with TIMP, 
<a HREF="mailto:sergey.laptenok@wur.nl"> Sergey Laptenok </a> 
developed the program below, which is
an executable for MS Windows.
