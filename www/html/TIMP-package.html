<h2>a problem solving environment for fitting superposition models</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Measurements often represent a superposition of the contributions of distinct
sub-systems resolved with respect to many experimental variables (time,
temperature, wavelength, pH, polarization, etc).  A parametric model for each
component may be desirable to apply to the data, but only to the evolution of
components with respect to a subset of the independent variables.  For
instance, given time-resolved spectroscopy data, a parametric model for the
time-evolution of components may be available, while a physically-inspired
parametric model for the spectra of components may be difficult to formulate
and interpret.  Such situations give rise to a separable nonlinear parameter
estimation problem, namely that of estimating the (nonlinear) parameters
associated with the parametric model, while estimating parameters representing
the evolution of components with respect to the independent variables to which
a parametric model does not apply as conditionally linear.  The partitioned
variable projection algorithm is well-suited to solving such problems under
the criteria of efficiency, quality of standard error estimates, and precision
of parameter estimates.  TIMP implements the partitioned variable projection
algorithm and allows its application to fitting a wide range of models,
including those for the simultaneous analysis of multiple datasets collected
under different experimental conditions.  The package has been extensively
applied to modeling data arising in spectroscopy experiments.
